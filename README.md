## Overview
The repo contains several sub-directories to give demonstration of packaging and distributing Python projects. The sample codes are from Appendix 4 in O'Reilly Book - Python Testing with pyteset.
I primarily use those codes for self-learning and refreshing on the topic before getting deep understanding on using pyteset.

## Set up
I strongly recommend to use virtual environments when setting up any Python projects. Please reference official guides - [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
